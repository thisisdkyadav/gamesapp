# Gi-Row - Games App

Gi-Row is a web application that allows users to play games, with an initial focus on Ludo. The application features user authentication, AI opponents, and real-time gameplay.

## Features

- **Ludo Game:** Play the classic board game Ludo.
- **AI Opponent:** Play against an AI for a single-player experience.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user login and registration using Firebase.
- **Real-time Updates:** (If applicable, based on Firebase usage for game state)
- **Responsive Design:** (Assuming, as it's a modern web app)

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend Services:** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore/Realtime Database for game state - _assumption, confirm from code if possible_)
- **Styling:** CSS

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `public/`: Contains static assets and the main `index.html` file.
- `src/`: Contains the main source code for the React application.
  - `ai/`: Logic for game AI (e.g., `ludoAI.js`).
  - `components/`: Reusable UI components (e.g., `Navbar.js`, `Alert.js`).
  - `config/`: Configuration files, such as Firebase setup (`firebase.js`).
  - `context/`: React context for state management (`context.js`).
  - `css/`: CSS files for styling different parts of the application.
  - `games/`: Core game logic (e.g., `Ludo.js`).
  - `ludoComponents/`: Components specific to the Ludo game.
  - `pages/`: Top-level page components (e.g., `Home.js`, `Authenticate.js`).
- `build/`: Contains the production build of the application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
